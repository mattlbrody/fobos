<P class="p0 ft0">FOBOS Collaboration Code of Conduct</P>
<P class="p1 ft1">V2.0, DRAFT, October 10th, 2019</P>
<P class="p2 ft1">Principles</P>
<P class="p3 ft2">The FOBOS Collaboration has gathered to design and deploy the <NOBR>Fiber-Optic</NOBR> Broadband Optical Spectrograph (FOBOS Collaboration) and to facilitate scientific programs to be carried out by this instrument. The Collaboration welcomes and respects all Collaboration members, regardless of race, ethnic origin, religious beliefs, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, or family and <NOBR>socio-economic</NOBR> status or cultural background. Indeed, the diversity of our Collaboration is a key factor in enabling the vibrant, productive, and supportive environment we seek to create.</P>
<P class="p4 ft2">The success of the FOBOS Collaboration depends on vigorous scientific and technical discourse within a framework of respect for all participants, including scientists, engineers, support staff at participating institutions, contractors, and Collaboration members at all levels. Interactions among FOBOS participants occur in many different contexts, including meetings, telecons, email exchanges on or off the mailing lists, and <NOBR>in-person</NOBR> exchanges. This Code of Conduct states the Collaboration’s expectation of respect and appropriate behavior in all of these interactions and outlines courses of action when this expectation is violated.</P>
<P class="p5 ft2">The FOBOS Collaboration will not tolerate harassment, bullying, or persistent unwelcome behavior of one individual or group against another. The Collaboration has a strong interest in nurturing the careers of junior scientists and engineers and protecting their stature and scientific freedom within the Collaboration. The Appendix quotes the definition of harassment adopted by the International Astronomical Union, which we also adopt here. Invitation to workshops, telecons, and email lists are a privilege extended by the Collaboration, and any member engaging in unprofessional behavior places their invitations to these forums at risk.</P>
<P class="p6 ft1">Discrimination</P>
<P class="p7 ft2">Members of the FOBOS Collaboration will treat each other with equity and respect, regardless of personal attributes including but not limited to: race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender expression, gender identity, ethnic origin, national origin, ancestry, marital status, pregnancy, physical or mental disability, medical condition, genetic information, military service, or political affiliation.</P>
<P class="p6 ft1">Harassment</P>
<P class="p8 ft3">The FOBOS Collaboration does not tolerate verbal, nonverbal, or physical harassment of any kind. This applies to all professional contexts. Behavior and language acceptable to one person may not be to another. Members will make every effort to ensure that words and actions communicate respect for others.</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_2">


<P class="p9 ft3">Sexual harassment is not tolerated in the FOBOS Collaboration, including, but not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, unwelcome requests for sexual favors, and other unwelcome verbal, nonverbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.</P>
<P class="p10 ft3">Bullying in any form, including physical bullying, verbal abuse, disparagement, intimidation, exclusion, or spreading personal rumors, is not tolerated.</P>
<P class="p6 ft1">Scientific Misconduct</P>
<P class="p11 ft3">Members of the FOBOS Collaboration will perform research in a welldocumented and ethically sound manner. Fabrication or falsification of data or results, plagiarism, violations of institutional Publication Policy, taking credit for others’ work, or any other scientific misconduct will not be tolerated.</P>
<P class="p12 ft1">FOBOS Meetings</P>
<P class="p13 ft2">All attendees at official <NOBR>FOBOS-sponsored</NOBR> meetings will agree to this Code of Conduct upon registration.</P>
<P class="p14 ft2">These inperson meetings will have two Meeting Contact Persons to support compliance with the Code of Conduct. They will be available to meeting attendees who are experiencing conflicts or disputes as part of the FOBOS meeting activities, including at meals and social events. Meeting Contact Persons shall have the authority to take actions intended to defuse a harmful situation resulting from behavior at the meeting, up to and including requiring an attendee to leave the meeting. They will report their actions directly to the FOBOS Principal Investigator (PI).</P>
<P class="p15 ft2">The FOBOS PI will select the Meeting Contact Persons and inform the FOBOS Collaboration prior to the meeting. The Meeting Contact Persons will be members of FOBOS who will be present for the duration of the Meeting. They will have a strong understanding of FOBOS policies and their authority to act as Meeting Contact Persons under these policies.</P>
<P class="p16 ft1">Adherence</P>
<P class="p17 ft2">All FOBOS Collaboration members are expected to abide by this Code of Conduct, and prospective members must agree to the terms of the Code of Conduct as a condition of joining the Collaboration. FOBOS is a voluntary collaboration between scientists<SPAN class="ft4">. </SPAN>FOBOS Participants are granted membership privileges at the discretion of the FOBOS Executive Committee and such privileges may be revoked, including removal from communication channels (e.g., mailing lists), loss of access to internal wiki sites, loss of the privilege of attending Collaboration meetings or telecons, and removal from leadership roles or committees.</P>
<P class="p18 ft6">In addition, the FOBOS Collaboration reserves the right to remove a member from FOBOS based on sanction or censure by the member’s department, institution, or professional society for activity that constitutes a violation of the FOBOS Code of Conduct<SPAN class="ft5">. </SPAN>Past sanctions or</P>
</DIV>
<DIV id="page_3">


<P class="p19 ft3">censure by a department, institution, or professional society for activity that constitutes a violation of the FOBOS Code of Conduct can be considered by the Executive Committee in judging new applications for FOBOS membership.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2">Sanction decisions will be described in a written communication to the individual or individuals facing the sanctions and communicated verbally to the complainant. The written report is intended to ensure clarity of communication, and verbatim posting of this report in a public forum would be considered a violation of the Code of the Conduct. The respondent and the complainant will both have an opportunity to file a written response to the decision within seven days. The Executive Committee reserves the right to change its decision on the basis of new evidence at any time and will notify both parties of any changes.</P>
<P class="p21 ft3">Individuals interested in pursuing formal complaints are encouraged to address complaints to the relevant employment institution(s). FOBOS management is available to help connect members to relevant officers at these institutions.</P>
<P class="p22 ft3">Retaliation toward a member who pursues any of these options, or toward anyone assisting either in the resolution process or in the investigation of a concern or complaint, is a violation of this Code.</P>
<P class="p20 ft2">In no circumstance does the FOBOS Code of Conduct supplant laws or institutional policies or requirements to which members of FOBOS or home institutions are subject, including reporting requirements of an individual or entity. It is understood that FOBOS members may report allegations of violations to home institutions, government agencies, or local authorities for investigation pursuant to applicable laws, regulations, and policies.</P>
<P class="p23 ft2">This Code of Conduct shall not be construed as creating any employeremployee, joint venture, partnership, duty, trust, obligation to pay, or other relationship between FOBOS, member institutions, grantors, funding institutions or agencies, home institutions, or members, including the FOBOS Executive Committee. Although FOBOS encourages all members to abide by this Code of Conduct, FOBOS remains a voluntary member body. Members and their affiliated institutions waive any and all claims, liabilities, or damages against FOBOS, member institutions, grantors, funding institutions or agencies, home institutions, and FOBOS members involved in implementing the Code of Conduct arising from the enforcement of, or failure to enforce, this Code of Conduct.</P>
<P class="p24 ft8">Acknowledgement: This FOBOS Code of Conduct has been adapted from the DESI and SDSS Codes of Conduct<SPAN class="ft7">.</SPAN></P>
